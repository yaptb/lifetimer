### Operating Modes

LifeTimer has two operating modes. These modes control how the Timer Window is displayed.

1. **Interactive Mode**

In Interactive Mode, the Timer Window acts like a regular window. Use this mode to position and resize the timer on your desktop.

2. **Background Mode**

In Background Mode, the Timer Window becomes transparent, moves behind all other windows and ignores user input. The Timer Window acts like desktop wallpaper.

### System Tray Icon

The LifeTimer System Tray Icon can be used to switch operating modes, open the Settings Window or exit the application.
This enables the application to be controlled when the it is running in Background Mode and the Settings Window is closed.

## LifeTimer Settings

The LifeTimer Settings Window is used to configure the behaviour of the application. The Settings Window has a side
navigation menu that can be used to switch between different pages. The following pages are available:

1. **Command Page**: Switch between modes. Save settings. Exit.
2. **Timers Page**: Configure the timers to display. Configure optional timer rotation.
3. **Appearance Page**: Configure the fonts, colors, borders and transparency of the timer display.
4. **Settings Page**: Configure startup behaviour.
5. **Help Page**: Links to this website and upgrade options.

Each settings page is described in more detail in the following sections

### Command Page

The Command Page provides the Main Menu for the application. This page has the following buttons

1. **Mode Toggle**: Switch the Browser between Interactive and Background modes.
2. **Save Settings**: Save the current application settings
3. **Quit Application**: Shut down and exit the LifeTimer application.

Please note that configuration changes are not automatically saved. All configuration changes must be manually saved using the 'Save Settings' for them to be remembered after the application restarts. This includes any changes on the Timer, Appearance or Settings pages.

### Appearance Page

The Appearance Page is used to configure how the Timer Window looks on your desktop. You can use this page to change the fonts, colors and border settings for the display.

## Professional Version Benefits

- The free version overlay message is removed and will no longer display
- The number of URL links that can be added is raised from 3 to 15
- Highest priority user support

## Troubleshooting

### Known Issues

**Windows Desktop Only:**

- LifeTimer is a Windows Desktop application and is not available for other operating systems

**Interactive Window Is Not Transparent:**

- This is by design. Making the interactive window transparent makes it harder to locate, move and resize.

**Desktop Icons are Covered:**

- This is by design. Applications that attach to the Windows Desktop and run behind the desktop icons require elevated privileges and can be a security risk. LifeTimer emulates a desktop window but avoids these security concerns. Unfortunately, this means that the LifeTimer browser window will obscure icons on the desktop even when it is running in Background Mode.

**Limited Windows 10 Support:**

- LifeTimer is designed for Windows 11 and may have issues with older versions of Windows 10
- Windows 10 users are encouraged to thoroughly evaluate the free version before purchasing an upgrade.
