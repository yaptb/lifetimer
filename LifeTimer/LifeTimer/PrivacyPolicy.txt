Privacy Policy
Effective Date: September 2025

This Privacy Policy outlines how LifeTimer ("the Application") handles data and user privacy. We are committed to maintaining transparency and ensuring that your information remains secure.

What LifeTimer Does
LifeTimer is built using WinUI 3 and utilizes the runFullTrust capability to enable a startup task. This allows the Application to launch automatically when your system starts, ensuring it is available when needed.

What LifeTimer Does Not Do
LifeTimer does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or private information. Specifically, the Application does not access or process:
- Names, email addresses, or contact details
- Location data
- Usage analytics or behavioral tracking
- Files, documents, or system data

System Permissions
The runFullTrust capability is used solely to register and manage the startup task. It does not grant access to personal files, system data, or any sensitive information.

Updates and Changes
If future updates introduce features that require data collection or internet connectivity, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly. Users will be notified prior to any such changes.
